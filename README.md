**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Pipeline**

This repository provides a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline designed to process and analyze text extracted from multiple document types.

The pipeline performs two main functions:

Text Extraction – Captures text content from structured and unstructured documents.

Entity Label Suggestion – Identifies and proposes candidate entity labels that are consistently present across each document type.

This approach is particularly useful for:

- Discovering common entity labels within document collections.

- Defining entity fields required for downstream data extraction tasks.

- Standardizing entity label usage across varied document sources.
